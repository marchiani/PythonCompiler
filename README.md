# Python compile project
The compiler is designed to compile Python code into .NET assemblies, allowing Python code to be executed on the .NET platform.

## Abilities
The Python Compiler project includes a command-line interface for compiling Python code into .NET assemblies. The compiler supports various Python language features such as modules, functions, classes, and exceptions, and can generate IL code that is compatible with the .NET runtime.

In addition to the compiler, the project includes a Python standard library implementation that provides a set of modules and functions that are compatible with the .NET platform. The standard library implementation includes modules for file I/O, regular expressions, math functions, and more.

## Conclusion
The Python Compiler project is designed to be extensible and supports the creation of custom modules and extensions. The project is open source and is licensed under the MIT License, allowing developers to modify and distribute the code as they see fit.

Overall, the Python Compiler project provides a useful tool for developers who wish to leverage the power of the .NET platform to execute Python code. It allows Python developers to write code that can be executed on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
